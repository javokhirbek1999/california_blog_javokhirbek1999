            California is a state in the Pacific Region of the United States.
            With 39.5 million residents across a total area of about 163,696
            square miles (423,970 km2), California is the most populous U.S.
            state and the third-largest by area, and is also the world's
            thirty-fourth most populous subnational entity. California is also
            the most populated subnational entity in North America, and has its
            state capital in Sacramento. The Greater Los Angeles Area and the
            San Francisco Bay Area are the nation's second- and fifth-most
            populous urban regions, with 18.7 million and 9.7 million residents
            respectively.[15] Los Angeles is California's most populous city,
            and the country's second-most populous, after New York City.
            California also has the nation's most populous county, Los Angeles
            County, and its largest county by area, San Bernardino County. The
            City and County of San Francisco is both the country's second most
            densely populated major city after New York City and the fifth most
            densely populated county, behind only four of the five New York City
            boroughs. California's economy, with a gross state product of $3.0
            trillion, is the largest sub-national economy in the world.[16] If
            it were a country, California would be the fifth-largest economy in
            the world,[17] and the 37th-most populous as of 2020.[18] The
            Greater Los Angeles Area and the San Francisco Bay Area are the
            nation's second- and third-largest urban economies ($1.3 trillion
            and $1.0 trillion respectively as of 2020), after the New York
            metropolitan area ($2.0 trillion).[19] The San Francisco Bay Area
            PSA had the nation's highest gross domestic product per capita in
            2018 ($106,757) among large primary statistical areas,[20] and is
            home to four of the world's ten largest companies by market
            capitalization[21] and four of the world's ten richest people.[22]
            California culture is considered a global trendsetter in popular
            culture, communication, information, innovation, environmentalism,
            economics, politics, and entertainment. As a result of the state's
            diversity and migration, California integrates foods, languages, and
            traditions from other areas across the country and around the globe.
            It is considered the origin of the American film industry, the
            hippie counterculture, barbecue, fast food, beach and car culture,
            the Internet,[23] and the personal computer,[24] among
            others.[25][26] The San Francisco Bay Area and the Greater Los
            Angeles Area are widely seen as centers of the global technology and
            entertainment industries, respectively. California's economy is very
            diverse: 58% of it is based on finance, government, real estate
            services, technology, and professional, scientific, and technical
            business services.[27] Although it accounts for only 1.5% of the
            state's economy,[27] California's agriculture industry has the
            highest output of any U.S. state.[28][29][30] California shares a
            border with Oregon to the north, Nevada and Arizona to the east, and
            the Mexican state of Baja California to the south. The state's
            diverse geography ranges from the Pacific Coast in the west to the
            Sierra Nevada mountain range in the east, and from the redwood and
            Douglas fir forests in the northwest to the Mojave Desert in the
            southeast. The Central Valley, a major agricultural area, dominates
            the state's center. Although California is well-known for its warm
            Mediterranean climate, the large size of the state results in
            climates that vary from moist temperate rainforest in the north to
            arid desert in the interior, as well as snowy alpine in the
            mountains. Over time, drought and wildfires have become more
            frequent.[31][32] What is now California was first settled by
            various Native Californian tribes before being explored by a number
            of Europeans during the 16th and 17th centuries. The Spanish Empire
            then claimed and colonized it. In 1804 it was included in Alta
            California province, within the Viceroyalty of New Spain. The area
            became a part of Mexico in 1821 following its successful war for
            independence but was ceded to the United States in 1848 after the
            Mexican–American War. The western portion of Alta California was
            then organized and admitted as the 31st state on September 9, 1850.
            The California Gold Rush starting in 1848 led to dramatic social and
            demographic changes, with large-scale emigration from the east and
            abroad with an accompanying economic boom.

            alt="Etymology"
          />
          <p>
            The Spaniards gave the name Las Californias to the peninsula of Baja
            California and to Alta California, the region that became the
            present-day states of California, Nevada, and Utah, and parts of
            Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and Wyoming.[33] The name likely derived
            from the mythical island of California in the fictional story of
            Queen Calafia, as recorded in a 1510 work The Adventures of
            Esplandián by Garci Rodríguez de Montalvo.[34] This work was the
            fifth in a popular Spanish chivalric romance series that began with
            Amadis de Gaula.[34][35][36][37] Queen Calafia's kingdom was said to
            be a remote land rich in gold and pearls, inhabited by beautiful
            black women who wore gold armor and lived like Amazons, as well as
            griffins and other strange beasts.[34][38][39] In the fictional
            paradise, the ruler Queen Calafia fought alongside Muslims and her
            name may have been chosen to echo the title of a Muslim leader, the
            Caliph. It is possible the name California was meant to imply the
            island was a Caliphate

            Settled by successive waves of arrivals during the last 10,000
            years, California was one of the most culturally and linguistically
            diverse areas in pre-Columbian North America. Various estimates of
            the native population range from 100,000 to 300,000.[42] The
            indigenous peoples of California included more than 70 distinct
            ethnic groups of Native Americans, ranging from large, settled
            populations living on the coast to groups in the interior.
            California groups also were diverse in their political organization
            with bands, tribes, villages, and on the resource-rich coasts, large
            chiefdoms, such as the Chumash, Pomo and Salinan. Trade,
            intermarriage and military alliances fostered many social and
            economic relationships among the diverse groups.

            The first European to explore the California coast as far north as
            the Russian River was a Spanish sailing expedition, led by
            Portuguese captain Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo, in 1542. Some 37 years
            later privateer and explorer Francis Drake also explored and claimed
            an undefined portion of the California coast in 1579. Spanish
            traders made unintended visits with the Manila galleons on their
            return trips from the Philippines beginning in 1565.[43] The first
            Asians to set foot on what would be the United States occurred in
            1587, when Filipino sailors arrived in Spanish ships at Morro
            Bay.[44] Sebastián Vizcaíno explored and mapped the coast of
            California in 1602 for New Spain. Despite the on-the-ground
            explorations of California in the 16th century, Rodríguez's idea of
            California as an island persisted. That depiction appeared on many
            European maps well into the 18th century.[45] After the Portolà
            expedition of 1769–70, Spanish missionaries led by Junipero Serra
            began setting up 21 California Missions on or near the coast of Alta
            (Upper) California, beginning in San Diego. During the same period,
            Spanish military forces built several forts (presidios) and three
            small towns (pueblos). The San Francisco Mission grew into the city
            of San Francisco, and two of the pueblos grew into the cities of Los
            Angeles and San Jose. Several other smaller cities and towns also
            sprang up surrounding the various Spanish missions and pueblos,
            which remain to this day. The Spanish colonization began decimating
            the natives through epidemics of various diseases for which the
            indigenous peoples had no natural immunity, such as measles and
            diphtheria.[46] The establishment of the Spanish systems of
            government and social structure, which the Spanish settlers had
            brought with them, also technologically and culturally overwhelmed
            the societies of the earlier indigenous peoples. During this same
            period, Russian ships also explored along the California coast and
            in 1812 established a trading post at Fort Ross. Russia's early
            19th-century coastal settlements in California were positioned just
            north of the northernmost edge of the area of Spanish settlement in
            San Francisco Bay, and were the southernmost Russian settlements in
            North America. The Russian settlements associated with Fort Ross
            were spread from Point Arena to Tomales Bay

            In 1821, the Mexican War of Independence gave Mexico (including
            California) independence from Spain. For the next 25 years, Alta
            California remained as a remote, sparsely populated, northwestern
            administrative district of the newly independent country of Mexico.
            After Mexican independence from Spain, the missions, which
            controlled most of the best land in the state, were secularized by
            1834 and became the property of the Mexican government.[49] The
            governor granted many square leagues of land to others with
            political influence. These huge ranchos or cattle ranches emerged as
            the dominant institutions of Mexican California. The ranchos
            developed under ownership by Californios (Hispanics native of
            California) who traded cowhides and tallow with Boston merchants.
            Beef did not become a commodity until the 1849 gold Rush. From the
            1820s, trappers and settlers from the United States and the future
            Canada arrived in Northern California. These new arrivals used the
            Siskiyou Trail, California Trail, Oregon Trail and Old Spanish Trail
            to cross the rugged mountains and harsh deserts in and surrounding
            California. The flag used by Juan Bautista Alvarado in his 1836
            independence movement The early government of the newly independent
            Mexico was highly unstable, and in a reflection of this, from 1831
            onwards, California also experienced a series of armed disputes,
            both internal and with the central Mexican government.[50] During
            this tumultuous political period Juan Bautista Alvarado was able to
            secure the governorship during 1836–1842.[51] The military action
            which first brought Alvarado to power had momentarily declared
            California to be an independent state, and had been aided by
            American and British residents of California,[52] including Isaac
            Graham.[53] In 1840, one hundred of those residents who did not have
            passports were arrested, leading to the Graham affair.[52] One of
            the largest ranchers in California was John Marsh. After failing to
            obtain justice against squatters on his land from the Mexican
            courts, he determined that California should become part of the
            United States. Marsh conducted a letter-writing campaign espousing
            the California climate, the soil, and other reasons to settle there,
            as well as the best route to follow, which became known as "Marsh's
            route". His letters were read, reread, passed around, and printed in
            newspapers throughout the country, and started the first wagon
            trains rolling to California.[54] He invited immigrants to stay on
            his ranch until they could get settled, and assisted in their
            obtaining passports.[55] After ushering in the period of organized
            emigration to California, Marsh helped end the rule of the last
            Mexican governor of California, thereby paving the way to
            California's ultimate acquisition by the United States.

            In 1846, a group of American settlers in and around Sonoma rebelled
            against Mexican rule during the Bear Flag Revolt. Afterwards, rebels
            raised the Bear Flag (featuring a bear, a star, a red stripe and the
            words "California Republic") at Sonoma. The Republic's only
            president was William B. Ide,[57] who played a pivotal role during
            the Bear Flag Revolt. This revolt by American settlers served as a
            prelude to the later American military invasion of California and
            was closely coordinated with nearby American military commanders.
            The California Republic was short lived;[58] the same year marked
            the outbreak of the Mexican–American War (1846–48).[59] When
            Commodore John D. Sloat of the United States Navy sailed into
            Monterey Bay and began the military occupation of California by the
            United States, Northern California capitulated in less than a month
            to the United States forces.[60] After a series of defensive battles
            in Southern California, the Treaty of Cahuenga was signed by the
            Californios on January 13, 1847, securing American control in
            California

            Following the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (February 2, 1848) that
            ended the war, the westernmost portion of the annexed Mexican
            territory of Alta California soon became the American state of
            California, and the remainder of the old territory was then
            subdivided into the new American Territories of Arizona, Nevada,
            Colorado and Utah. The even more lightly populated and arid lower
            region of old Baja California remained as a part of Mexico. In 1846,
            the total settler population of the western part of the old Alta
            California had been estimated to be no more than 8,000, plus about
            100,000 Native Americans, down from about 300,000 before Hispanic
            settlement in 1769.[62] In 1848, only one week before the official
            American annexation of the area, gold was discovered in California,
            this being an event which was to forever alter both the state's
            demographics and its finances. Soon afterward, a massive influx of
            immigration into the area resulted, as prospectors and miners
            arrived by the thousands. The population burgeoned with United
            States citizens, Europeans, Chinese and other immigrants during the
            great California Gold Rush. By the time of California's application
            for statehood in 1850, the settler population of California had
            multiplied to 100,000. By 1854, more than 300,000 settlers had
            come.[63] Between 1847 and 1870, the population of San Francisco
            increased from 500 to 150,000.[64] California was suddenly no longer
            a sparsely populated backwater, but seemingly overnight it had grown
            into a major population center. The seat of government for
            California under Spanish and later Mexican rule had been located in
            Monterey from 1777 until 1845.[49] Pio Pico, last Mexican governor
            of Alta California, had briefly moved the capital to Los Angeles in
            1845. The United States consulate had also been located in Monterey,
            under consul Thomas O. Larkin. In 1849, a state Constitutional
            Convention was first held in Monterey. Among the first tasks of the
            Convention was a decision on a location for the new state capital.
            The first full legislative sessions were held in San Jose
            (1850–1851). Subsequent locations included Vallejo (1852–1853), and
            nearby Benicia (1853–1854); these locations eventually proved to be
            inadequate as well. The capital has been located in Sacramento since
            1854[65] with only a short break in 1862 when legislative sessions
            were held in San Francisco due to flooding in Sacramento. Once the
            state's Constitutional Convention had finalized its state
            constitution, it applied to the U.S. Congress for admission to
            statehood. On September 9, 1850, as part of the Compromise of 1850,
            California became a free state and September 9 a state holiday.
            During the American Civil War (1861–1865), California was able to
            send gold shipments eastwards to Washington in support of the Union
            cause;[66] however, due to the existence of a large contingent of
            pro-South sympathizers within the state, the state was not able to
            muster any full military regiments to send eastwards to officially
            serve in the Union war effort. Still, several smaller military units
            within the Union army were unofficially associated with the state of
            California, such as the "California 100 Company", due to a majority
            of their members being from California. At the time of California's
            admission into the Union, travel between California and the rest of
            the continental United States had been a time-consuming and
            dangerous feat. Nineteen years afterwards, in 1869, shortly after
            the conclusion of the Civil War, a more direct connection was
            developed with the completion of the First Transcontinental Railroad
            in 1869. California was then easy to reach. Much of the state was
            extremely well suited to fruit cultivation and agriculture in
            general. Vast expanses of wheat, other cereal crops, vegetable
            crops, cotton, and nut and fruit trees were grown (including oranges
            in Southern California), and the foundation was laid for the state's
            prodigious agricultural production in the Central Valley and
            elsewhere. Indigenous peoples Yokayo, a village of Pomo people, in
            Ukiah, Mendocino County; c. 1916. Under earlier Spanish and Mexican
            rule, California's original native population had precipitously
            declined, above all, from Eurasian diseases to which the indigenous
            people of California had not yet developed a natural immunity.[67]
            Under its new American administration, California's harsh
            governmental policies towards its own indigenous people did not
            improve. As in other American states, many of the native inhabitants
            were soon forcibly removed from their lands by incoming American
            settlers such as miners, ranchers, and farmers. Although California
            had entered the American union as a free state, the "loitering or
            orphaned Indians" were de facto enslaved by their new Anglo-American
            masters under the 1853 Act for the Government and Protection of
            Indians.[citation needed] There were also massacres in which
            hundreds of indigenous people were killed. Between 1850 and 1860,
            the California state government paid around 1.5 million dollars
            (some 250,000 of which was reimbursed by the federal government)[68]
            to hire militias whose purpose was to protect settlers from the
            indigenous populations. In later decades, the native population was
            placed in reservations and rancherias, which were often small and
            isolated and without enough natural resources or funding from the
            government to sustain the populations living on them.[citation
            needed] As a result, the rise of California was a calamity for the
            native inhabitants. Several scholars and Native American activists,
            including Benjamin Madley and Ed Castillo, have described the
            actions of the California government as a genocide

            California is the 3rd largest state in the United States in area,
            after Alaska and Texas.[88] California is often geographically
            bisected into two regions, Southern California, comprising the 10
            southernmost counties,[89][90] and Northern California, comprising
            the 48 northernmost counties.[91][92] It is bordered by Oregon to
            the north, Nevada to the east and northeast, Arizona to the
            southeast, the Pacific Ocean to the west and it shares an
            international border with the Mexican state of Baja California to
            the south (with which it makes up part of The Californias region of
            North America, alongside Baja California Sur). In the middle of the
            state lies the California Central Valley, bounded by the Sierra
            Nevada in the east, the coastal mountain ranges in the west, the
            Cascade Range to the north and by the Tehachapi Mountains in the
            south. The Central Valley is California's productive agricultural
            heartland. Divided in two by the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta,
            the northern portion, the Sacramento Valley serves as the watershed
            of the Sacramento River, while the southern portion, the San Joaquin
            Valley is the watershed for the San Joaquin River. Both valleys
            derive their names from the rivers that flow through them. With
            dredging, the Sacramento and the San Joaquin Rivers have remained
            deep enough for several inland cities to be seaports. The
            Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta is a critical water supply hub
            for the state. Water is diverted from the delta and through an
            extensive network of pumps and canals that traverse nearly the
            length of the state, to the Central Valley and the State Water
            Projects and other needs. Water from the Delta provides drinking
            water for nearly 23 million people, almost two-thirds of the state's
            population as well as water for farmers on the west side of the San
            Joaquin Valley. Suisun Bay lies at the confluence of the Sacramento
            and San Joaquin Rivers. The water is drained by the Carquinez
            Strait, which flows into San Pablo Bay, a northern extension of San
            Francisco Bay, which then connects to the Pacific Ocean via the
            Golden Gate strait. The Channel Islands are located off the Southern
            coast, while the Farallon Islands lie west of San Francisco. The
            Sierra Nevada (Spanish for "snowy range") includes the highest peak
            in the contiguous 48 states, Mount Whitney, at 14,505 feet (4,421
            m).[4][5][6] The range embraces Yosemite Valley, famous for its
            glacially carved domes, and Sequoia National Park, home to the giant
            sequoia trees, the largest living organisms on Earth, and the deep
            freshwater lake, Lake Tahoe, the largest lake in the state by
            volume. To the east of the Sierra Nevada are Owens Valley and Mono
            Lake, an essential migratory bird habitat. In the western part of
            the state is Clear Lake, the largest freshwater lake by area
            entirely in California. Although Lake Tahoe is larger, it is divided
            by the California/Nevada border. The Sierra Nevada falls to Arctic
            temperatures in winter and has several dozen small glaciers,
            including Palisade Glacier, the southernmost glacier in the United
            States. About 45 percent of the state's total surface area is
            covered by forests,[93] and California's diversity of pine species
            is unmatched by any other state. California contains more forestland
            than any other state except Alaska. Many of the trees in the
            California White Mountains are the oldest in the world; an
            individual bristlecone pine is over 5,000 years old.[94][95] In the
            south is a large inland salt lake, the Salton Sea. The south-central
            desert is called the Mojave; to the northeast of the Mojave lies
            Death Valley, which contains the lowest and hottest place in North
            America, the Badwater Basin at −279 feet (−85 m).[8] The horizontal
            distance from the bottom of Death Valley to the top of Mount Whitney
            is less than 90 miles (140 km). Indeed, almost all of southeastern
            California is arid, hot desert, with routine extreme high
            temperatures during the summer. The southeastern border of
            California with Arizona is entirely formed by the Colorado River,
            from which the southern part of the state gets about half of its
            water. A majority of California's cities are located in either the
            San Francisco Bay Area or the Sacramento metropolitan area in
            Northern California; or the Los Angeles area, the Riverside-San
            Bernardino-Inland Empire, or the San Diego metropolitan area in
            Southern California. The Los Angeles Area, the Bay Area, and the San
            Diego metropolitan area are among several major metropolitan areas
            along the California coast. As part of the Ring of Fire, California
            is subject to tsunamis, floods, droughts, Santa Ana winds,
            wildfires, landslides on steep terrain, and has several volcanoes.
            It has many earthquakes due to several faults running through the
            state, the largest being the San Andreas Fault. About 37,000
            earthquakes are recorded each year, but most are too small to be
            felt.

            Although most of the state has a Mediterranean climate, due to the
            state's large size the climate ranges from polar to subtropical. The
            cool California Current offshore often creates summer fog near the
            coast. Farther inland, there are colder winters and hotter summers.
            The maritime moderation results in the shoreline summertime
            temperatures of Los Angeles and San Francisco being the coolest of
            all major metropolitan areas of the United States and uniquely cool
            compared to areas on the same latitude in the interior and on the
            east coast of the North American continent. Even the San Diego
            shoreline bordering Mexico is cooler in summer than most areas in
            the contiguous United States. Just a few miles inland, summer
            temperature extremes are significantly higher, with downtown Los
            Angeles being several degrees warmer than at the coast. The same
            microclimate phenomenon is seen in the climate of the Bay Area,
            where areas sheltered from the sea experience significantly hotter
            summers than nearby areas closer to the ocean. Northern parts of the
            state have more rain than the south. California's mountain ranges
            also influence the climate: some of the rainiest parts of the state
            are west-facing mountain slopes. Northwestern California has a
            temperate climate, and the Central Valley has a Mediterranean
            climate but with greater temperature extremes than the coast. The
            high mountains, including the Sierra Nevada, have an alpine climate
            with snow in winter and mild to moderate heat in summer.
            California's mountains produce rain shadows on the eastern side,
            creating extensive deserts. The higher elevation deserts of eastern
            California have hot summers and cold winters, while the low deserts
            east of the Southern California mountains have hot summers and
            nearly frostless mild winters. Death Valley, a desert with large
            expanses below sea level, is considered the hottest location in the
            world; the highest temperature in the world,[98][99] 134 °F (56.7
            °C), was recorded there on July 10, 1913. The lowest temperature in
            California was −45 °F (−43 °C) on January 20, 1937 in Boca.[100] The
            table below lists average temperatures for January and August in a
            selection of places throughout the state; some highly populated and
            some not. This includes the relatively cool summers of the Humboldt
            Bay region around Eureka, the extreme heat of Death Valley, and the
            mountain climate of Mammoth in the Sierra Nevadas.
